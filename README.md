I'm a Computer Science PhD student at the University of Toronto and Vector Institute co-advised by Rahul Krishnan, Michael Wainberg, and Bo Wang. My research focuses on large language models (LLMs) and their application to biomedicine with a focus on genomics, multimodality, causality, and reasoning. 

Previously, I earned my MSc in Computer Science at the University of Toronto and Vector Institute. Before that I earned my BASc in Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Waterloo, where I completed co-op terms focused on machine learning and computational biology research at DarwinAI (acquired by Apple), IQVIA, and the University of Toronto.
